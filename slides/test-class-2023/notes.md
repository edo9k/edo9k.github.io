# Stuff I still want to add to the slides

  - the cost of data breach page https://ibm.com/reports/data-breach
  - the Anderson's Rule page (with the wikipedia link) 
  - the SQL Injection exercise from Hack This Website (maybe talk about Google Dorks too?)
  - tio.run small user database to be manipulated as an example
  - add image of the Oracle DB machines that run the Brazilian election
  - add image of the Banestes server cold room (also a safe room)
  - if time allows: less conventional databases:
    - blockchain based
    - immudb (also immutable, but less power hungry than blockchain)
    - sqlite (and talk about the fact it's everywhere)

# topics to bring up (if you pass the test) 

  - RedHat partnership? (might extend to IBM full partnership)
